# MI-AI Methodology

This document outlines how SAMHSA's TIP 35 Motivational Interviewing guidelines were adapted for an AI context.

## Core MI Principles Implementation

### 1. Express Empathy (TIP 35, Chapter 3)
- **Original Principle**: Using reflective listening to understand the client's perspective
- **AI Implementation**: 
  - Natural language reflections
  - Contextual response to emotions
  - Use of "you" language to maintain focus on client
  - Avoidance of "I" statements that could feel inauthentic

### 2. Support Self-Efficacy (TIP 35, Chapter 3)
- **Original Principle**: Reinforcing client's belief in their ability to change
- **AI Implementation**:
  - Early focus on strengths and past successes
  - Recognition and amplification of capabilities
  - Strategic affirmations based on client statements
  - Connection to previous achievements

### 3. Roll with Resistance (TIP 35, Chapter 5)
- **Original Principle**: Avoiding argumentation and direct confrontation
- **AI Implementation**:
  - Dynamic response to resistance signals
  - Use of double-sided reflections
  - Emphasis on personal choice and control
  - Strategic amplification to elicit self-correction

## Stages of Change Implementation

### Precontemplation Stage (TIP 35, Chapter 4)
- **Original Guidelines**: Focus on rapport and raising awareness
- **AI Adaptation**:
  - Exploratory questions about current situation
  - Gentle reflection of potential concerns
  - Emphasis on understanding client's perspective
  - No pressure for immediate change

### Contemplation Stage (TIP 35, Chapter 4)
- **Original Guidelines**: Explore ambivalence and develop discrepancy
- **AI Adaptation**:
  - Recognition of change talk
  - Exploration of values and goals
  - Double-sided reflections of ambivalence
  - Connection of current behavior to personal values
