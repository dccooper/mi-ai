## üìö Evidence-Based Methodology

MI-AI implements Motivational Interviewing techniques based on the widely respected [SAMHSA's TIP 35: Enhancing Motivation for Change in Substance Use Disorder Treatment](https://library.samhsa.gov/product/tip-35-enhancing-motivation-change-substance-use-disorder-treatment/pep19-02-01-003) (2019).

Motivational Interviewing is a collaborative, person-centered approach that encourages individuals to explore their own motivations and resolve ambivalence about behavior change.
